<p>
                                    No - OverTrack is not intended as a cheat, and care has been taken to avoid anything
                                    that could be considered cheating.
                                </p>
<p>
                                    The OverTrack client <b>does not and will never</b> modify game behaviour, read game
                                    memory/network access, or otherwise reveal information that is intended to be
                                    hidden. OverTrack behaves just like any other screen recording software on your PC
                                    e.g. OBS, Shadowplay, and offers no advantage beyond that of carefully watching back
                                    VODs of every game you played while entering data into a spreadsheet. All data is
                                    collected by processing screenshots, extracting visual information that would be
                                    available to anyone watching the VOD or replay.
                                </p>
<p>
                                    OverTrack only uploads data after a game completes, so there is no in-game advantage
                                    provided. Since OverTrack’s data is not realtime, any advantage OverTrack offers
                                    could be achieved by a human with a notebook watching VODs.

<p>
                                    On May 10 2019, all users of OverTrack for Overwatch were temporarily banned for a
                                    period of approximately one hour. This ban was promptly reverted (presumably once
                                    Blizzard was made aware of the situation), and there exist no known existing bans
                                    stemming from the use of OverTrack.
                                </p>
<p>
                                    Users are advised to use their own discretion over the use of OverTrack as no
                                    official stance has been published. Keep in mind however, that Overwatch maintains a
                                    blacklist of software that is determined to be against TOS and it will refuse to
                                    launch if any running programs match this blacklist. Currently OverTrack is not in
                                    this blacklist, however if you at any point receive this error it is advised to stop
                                    using OverTrack until the issue is resolved.

                                    under all programs &gt; OverTrack launcher.<br/> To stop using OverTrack, you can
                                    remove it through "Add or remove programs" or just disable 'Launch on Startup' in
                                    the Settings menu in from the taskbar.

                                    If you are getting the error <code>DLL load failed</code> you may need to download
                                    and install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:

<p>To minimize the performance impact (e.g. to reduce FPS stutter, lag, and lost FPS) of
                                    OverTrack you can try the following
                                </p>
<ul>
<li>Use the OBS capture mode (join the <a href="https://discord.gg/JywstAB">OverTrack
                                        Discord</a> for help setting it up)
                                    </li>
<li>Set your game's process priority to High and OverTrack's to Below Normal (right
                                        click the process in the details tab of task manager)
                                    </li>
<li>Set the CPU affinity on OverTrack to constrain it to a single core/CPU</li>
</ul>
<p>
                                    Priority and affinity settings will revert on restart, but can be made permanent by
                                    editing the OverTrack shortcut located in <code>%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start
                                    Menu\Programs\Startup</code> to have the target <code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /C
